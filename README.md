# UML---Management-system-for-travelers-and-traveling-groups
UML model of a fictive Management system for travelers and traveling groups.

This project was part of a school submission at FIIT STU. We had to create a UML model of a management system. Project was made with
Enterprise Architect.

## A major part of the project is the realization of the project of a software system model creation. The project consists of the following parts: 
  -  Project objective
  -  Use case definition and use case diagram
    *  The use case model consists of the textually expressed use cases and the corresponding use case diagrams in UML.
       Prepare the use case diagrams and submit them as a model in EA. Take care to have at least one **include**, one **extend**, and one              **generalization** relationship between use cases, and to have these among the use cases that have been described
        
    *  Organize use cases into the diagrams according to the subject. The use case diagrams themselves 
      
    *  Prepared **sequence diagrams** for selected use cases (their flows) and for the same use cases also prepared **activity diagrams** 
      ** Apply the advanced elements of sequence and activity diagrams.

  -  Objects, Classes and interaction
      *  in a class diagram as a basic structural model.
      
      * Organized classes into packages. Identified dependencies between packages and visualized in a package diagram. 
      
      *  Usege of sequence diagrams to specify selected methods. 
      
      *  Usage of state diagrams to express the state space of the objects of selected classes, system, or system part. 
      
      *  Some pre/post conditions, invariants, operations are expressed in in OCL.
           
      *  Introduce the corresponding code for the selected part of the model.
          
  -  Components
      *  Use component diagrams to express the architecture. Express the component interaction using sequence diagrams.
  -  Code
  -  Algebraic spcification
    *  Usage of algebraic specification to express a chosen class from your model.
    *  Express the specification in a separate text file. Marked  all four parts of an algebraic specification: types, functions, axioms,
       and   preconditions.
     
  -  Feauture model


The course is focused on expressing software at all levels of development by adequate models. From the initial specification to implementation, each software model can be perceived as a specification, and the software development process can be perceived as refinement or concretization of the specification. A special attention is paid to use cases and UML, but the course also presents formal approaches to software modeling.
